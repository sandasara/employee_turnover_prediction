In April 2009, I was assigned the task of representing the business in managing this transition. Specific responsibilities were :- Ensure that the project went through recommended project milestones and that each of them were signed off having satisfied requirements of the business.- Project timeline to be adhered to. - Specify requirements with clarity and precision to the consulting team so that investment was kept within what was predicted.- Lead a team of key users who represented individual modules. I personally acted as the key user for Customer Order Processing and Manufacturing modules whilst having colleagues to support in Finance and Warehousing. - Regular and timely communication to the relevant user groups in the business regarding key configuration decisions and their rationale- Identification and implementation of change management projects in preparation for the net change to be experienced as a result of the change from legacy to ERPWe took the project live as scheduled in April 2010. Since then Brandix Essentials has completed its first year in ERP.I was assigned as a member in the project to roll the solution to the next business cluster Brandix Intimates.

Initially setup for producing apparel using knitted fabric, the aim was to take advantage of AGOA duty free access to USA. In early 2006, 2 of the partners withdrew from the venture in order to concentrate on locations close to their home base in South Asia. The regional partner was Groupe Socota who were in textile manufacture. Seeing this as a logical extension to their business, the group took over and I stayed on as GM of the business to ensure stability, growth and eventual grooming of a successor.With a strong marketing focus, the customer mix, choice of product and the operating model was systematically changed in line with well constructed plans over the next 3 years. My main responsibilties were:- Responsible for topline and bottomline results of the company - Budgeting and preparation of the 5 year business plan- Strategic input in plans to systematically change customer \/ product \/ market mix in order to manage risk and align the company as a vertical partner in the group which was already in textile manufacture- Providing leadership to HR in a 2000 member organisation I handed over duties to my successor in early 2009 at which point the company had achieved the following- Moved markets from being predominantly USA to a mix of Europe + South Africa. In hindsight this was a wise move given that Madagascar lost AGOA duty free access to USA subsequently in 2009.- Moved the raw material base from knitted to woven fabric to align the company with group strength- Penetrated many tier 1 Brands including M&S \/ Zara in Europe and Woolworths in South Africa- Improved the skill base of the company from being a contract manufacture to that of a full service provider including apprarel design and logistics solutions in the form of DDU and DDP commercial terms.Cottonline today is a vibrant going concern which has grown in strength.
